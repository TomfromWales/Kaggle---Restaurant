The idea is to with minimal modification bring added value to submission.

Most of the data gets written back to the data folder as rds:
```{r}
rds_list <- gsub(".rds","",list.files(path=paste0(project_wd,"/data"),pattern="rds"))
rds_list
```

Load them all:
```{r}
for (filename in rds_list)
{assign(filename,readRDS(paste0(project_wd,"/data/",filename,".rds")))}
```

Get the ids in sample submission (last ten characters are the visit date of the restaurant):
```{r}
sample_sub_ids <- sample_submission %>%
                  select(id) %>%
                  mutate(id=substr(id,1,nchar(id)-11)) %>%
                  unique
```

There are `r nrow(sample_sub_ids)` restaurants for which we want to predict visit volume.
